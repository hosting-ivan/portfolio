          Sensory Orders is conceived around the premise of three “orders” – the
          organic realm of human bodies and natural entities, the technological
          realm of machines, and the symbolic realm of human culture. The
          combination of global pandemic, political-economic fallout, continuing
          ecological and the social-cultural crises have revealed how these
          three orders more than ever sense, act on and affect each other.<br />
          <br />
          In such disarray, we are paradoxically empowered by a vast array of
          communication and sensing tools. Centralized mass culture has given
          way to uncharted micro spheres with an ability to engulf wider
          spheres. Billions of sensors, devices and interfaces may give us a
          sense of control over all aspects of our life and work, but no one, no
          organization, no concept, nothing is protected from the virality of
          ongoing disruptions. <br />
          <br />If we can sense everything around us, we can never be sure if
          and how the signal relates to the source. As thinkers and creators, we
          act as agents of sensory transmissions, but what is the nature of our
          subjects and how is our practice affected by the turmoil of our days?
          How do we sense and literally make sense? Sensory Orders is a mix of
          27 responses by visual and performing artists, anthropologists,
          designers, sociologists, architects, historians of science, composers,
          physicists, architects and other researchers from 15 countries and 4
          continents. The perspectives reflect on a wide mix of human, technical
          and biological forces. As such, they seek to demonstrate, how the
          separation between human, animal, plant, machine and terrestrial is
          not as great as we might think.
